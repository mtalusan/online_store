Notes:
- Make sure to use the names for variables as outlined in the diagrams! Or notify the rest of us and change the diagrams and terms to reflect the change.
- Make your own "credentials.txt" containing your login for mariadb BUT do NOT add it to the repo. It's fine if git status returns a few untracked files in red. You can still add, commit, and push as normal.
- It'll probably save you some time to create a utility file to connect to MariaDB. There's an example of this in the repo (openMariaDB.php)
- Include your version of "openMariaDB.php" and "credentials" in all code that needs to query the DB
