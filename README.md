Notes:
- Make sure to use the names for variables as outlined in the diagrams! Or notify the rest of us and change the diagrams and terms to reflect the change.
- Make your own "credentials.txt" containing your login for mariadb BUT do NOT add it to the repo. It's fine if git status returns a few untracked files in red. You can still add, commit, and push as normal.
